Features

    View Users: Displays a list of users with details such as ID, first name, last name, email, and department.
    Add User: Allows you to add a new user by filling in a form with details like first name, last name, email, and department.
    Edit User: Allows editing the details of an existing user.
    Responsive Design: The interface is responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile screens.
    Modal: Uses React Modal for adding and editing users.

Challenges Faced

    API Simulation: Since the application uses JSONPlaceholder (a mock API), the changes (adding, editing) don't persist. This required some workarounds, like simulating a successful API call without actual data persistence.

    State Management: Handling form state and modal visibility at the same time was tricky. Ensuring that the modal opened with the correct data for editing and that the form data was correctly passed and handled was challenging initially.

    Styling: Tailwind CSS allowed for easy customization, but getting the modal centered properly, along with ensuring it looked consistent across different screen sizes, required some trial and error with utility classes.

Improvements

If given more time, I would:

    Persistent Data: Replace the mock API (JSONPlaceholder) with a real backend or implement local storage to persist data between sessions.

    Error Handling: Improve error handling for API requests. For example, add retry mechanisms or more specific error messages to help the user understand what went wrong.

    User Feedback: Add success/error notifications or loading indicators for better user experience, particularly during API interactions.

    Unit and Integration Testing: Write tests to ensure that the applicationâ€™s functionalities (e.g., adding, editing, and deleting users) work as expected. This could be done with tools like Jest and React Testing Library.

    Styling Enhancements: Although the application is functional, further polishing of the design could be done, especially the form fields and button styles, for a more modern and cohesive look.

Technologies Used

    React: For building the user interface.
    Tailwind CSS: For styling the application.
    React Modal: For displaying modals for adding and editing users.
    JSONPlaceholder: For simulating a backend API to fetch, add, and edit user data.
